# Impact-of-Study-Hours-on-Academic-Performance
Project Work

# Introduction
As part of project work in the Data Analytics class organized by PSP_Analytics, one of the analytics projects I’ll be working on is the Study-Hours-on-Academic-Performance Dataset .
This report presents an analysis of the impact of study hours on the academic performance of students at Bayero University, Kano. The study explores students' study habits, preferred study environments, factors influencing their academic achievements and other data.
The goal of this work is to develop recommendations to optimize students' study hours for better performance. Also, Propose strategies for effective time management and study planning. And to Interpret data to identify trends and insights.

# Data Sourcing
This dataset used in this work is obtained from students of Bayero University, Kano via Google Forms which will be distributed through various Whatsapp platforms. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKX1kIzjCo89MtWzXjZpW3WsW1iH5VYZeeUz0EGDwecEHNng/viewform?usp=sharing ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc5dfa37-d30c-4331-8e44-c0c4f7018ab4)

# Data Preparation
  - Compile and organize data using MS Excel
  - Analyze data using statistical software


# Data Cleaning/Transformation
To clean the dataset, I followed a structured process to ensure accuracy and consistency. Here’s how I did it:
When I first opened the dataset, I noticed that some responses were incomplete, and a few had inconsistent formatting. My first task was removing duplicate entries to ensure that each student's response was counted only once.
Next, I checked for missing values in key columns like study hours, CGPA, and preferred study time. Some fields were blank, so I decided to fill them with relevant fill-ins or remove them if they lacked essential information.
To maintain uniformity, some CGPA values were written as "3.50 - 4.49" while others used decimal points. I ensured that all were categorized properly into First-Class, Second-Class Upper, and Second-Class Lower.
There were also inconsistencies in the "Level of Study" column. Some students wrote “200” while others wrote “200 Level.” I made sure all levels followed the same format. Additionally, I capitalized all course names under the "Department" column to keep them consistent.
After structuring the dataset, I created pivot tables to analyze the correlation between study hours and CGPA. This helped me observe patterns, such as students studying 2-6 hours per day performing better than those who studied less than 2 hours.
Finally, I verified the cleaned data by cross-checking sample responses to ensure no critical information was lost in the process. With everything set, I saved the cleaned dataset, ready for analysis!


# Data Analysis/Visualization
Key Findings

1.	Study Hours vs. Academic Performance:
  - The majority of students (106) who study 2-6 hours per day fall within the Second-Class Lower category, while 34 students in this range achieved First-Class grades.
  - Students who study less than 2 hours per day have fewer First-Class students (only 5) and a higher concentration of lower CGPA students.
  - Students studying more than 6 hours per day are fewer but tend to perform better, with 10 achieving First-Class and only 2 falling into the Second-Class Lower category.

# Conclusion
The analysis suggests that moderate study hours (2-6 hours per day) are the most common among students, with a positive correlation to better academic performance. However, students who study extensively (more than 6 hours) also show promising results. Addressing challenges such as distractions and motivation could further enhance students’ academic success.
This report provides useful insights for educators and students looking to optimize study strategies for better performance.
